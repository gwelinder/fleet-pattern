# Production-Ready Use Cases

## Key Principles:
1. Each DO should be self-contained and useful in isolation
2. Communication between DOs should enhance functionality, not be required for basic operation
3. The edge location should provide meaningful advantages
4. State persistence should enable unique capabilities
5. Real-time interaction should be core to the design
