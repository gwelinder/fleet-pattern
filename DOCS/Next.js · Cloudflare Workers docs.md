## New apps

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Cloudflare using [`@opennextjs/cloudflare` ↗](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare), run:

- [npm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2087)
- [pnpm](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2088)
- [yarn](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2089)

```expressive
npm create cloudflare@latest my-next-app -- --framework=next --experimental
```

For setup, select the following options:

- For *What would you like to start with?*, choose `Framework Starter`.
- For *Which development framework do you want to use?*, choose `Next.js`.
- Complete the framework's own CLI wizard.
- For *Do you want to use git for version control?*, choose `Yes`.
- For *Do you want to deploy your application?*, choose `No` (we will be making some changes before deploying).

## Existing Next.js apps

### 1\. Install @opennextjs/cloudflare

First, install [@opennextjs/cloudflare ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare):

```expressive
npm install --save-dev @opennextjs/cloudflare
```

### 2\. Add a Wrangler file

Then, add a [`wrangler.toml / wrangler.json` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/) to the root directory of your Next.js app:

- [wrangler.json](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2092)
- [wrangler.toml](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2093)

```expressive
{  "main": ".open-next/worker.js",  "name": "my-app",  "compatibility_date": "2024-09-23",  "compatibility_flags": [    "nodejs_compat"  ],  "assets": {    "directory": ".open-next/assets",    "binding": "ASSETS"  }}
```

You configure your Worker and define what resources it can access via [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) in the `wrangler.toml / wrangler.json` file.

### 3\. Update `package.json`

Add the following to the scripts field of your `package.json` file:

```expressive
"build:worker": "opennextjs-cloudflare","dev:worker": "wrangler dev --port 8771","preview:worker": "npm run build:worker && npm run dev:worker","deploy:worker": "npm run build:worker && wrangler deploy"
```

- `npm run build:worker`: Runs the [@opennextjs/cloudflare ↗](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare) adapter. This first builds your app by running `next build` behind the scenes, and then transforms the build output to a format that you can run locally using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) and deploy to Cloudflare.
- `npm run dev:worker`: Takes the output generated by `build:worker` and runs it locally in [workerd ↗](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd), the open-source Workers Runtime, allowing you to run the app locally in the same environment that it will run in production. If you instead run `next dev`, your app will run in Node.js, which is a different JavaScript runtime from the Workers runtime, with differences in behavior and APIs.
- `npm run preview:worker`: Runs `build:worker` and then `dev:worker`, allowing you to quickly preview your app running locally in the Workers runtime, via a single command.
- `npm run deploy:worker`: Builds your app, and then deploys it to Cloudflare

### 4\. Add caching with Workers KV

`opennextjs/cloudflare` uses [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) as the cache for your Next.js app. Workers KV is [fast ↗](https://blog.cloudflare.com/faster-workers-kv) and uses Cloudflare's [Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) to increase cache hit rates. When you write cached data to Workers KV, you write to storage that can be read by any Cloudflare location. This means your app can fetch data, cache it in KV, and then be read by subsequent requests from this cache anywhere in the world.

To enable caching, you must:

#### Create a KV namespace

```expressive
npx wrangler@latest kv namespace create NEXT_CACHE_WORKERS_KV
```

#### Add the KV namespace to your Worker

- [wrangler.json](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2090)
- [wrangler.toml](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/frameworks/framework-guides/nextjs/#tab-panel-2091)

```expressive
{  "kv_namespaces": [    {      "binding": "NEXT_CACHE_WORKERS_KV",      "id": "<YOUR_NAMESPACE_ID>"    }  ]}
```

#### Set the name of the binding to `NEXT_CACHE_WORKERS_KV`

As shown above, the name of the binding that you configure for the KV namespace must be set to `NEXT_CACHE_WORKERS_KV`.

### 5\. Develop locally

You can continue to run `next dev` when developing locally.

### 6\. Preview locally your application and create an OpenNext config file

In step 3, we also added the `npm run preview:worker`, which allows you to quickly preview your app running locally in the Workers runtime, rather than in Node.js. This allows you to test changes in the same runtime that your app runs in, when deployed to Cloudflare.

To preview your application in such way run:

This command will build your OpenNext application, also creating, if not already present, an `open-next.configs.ts` file for you. This is necessary if you want to deploy your application with a GibHub/GitLab integration as presented in the next step.

### 7\. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

Either deploy via the command line:

Or [connect a GitHub or GitLab repository](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/), and Cloudflare will automatically build and deploy each pull request you merge to your production branch.

## Static assets

You can serve static assets your Next.js application by placing them in the `./public/` directory. This can be useful for resource files such as images, stylesheets, fonts, and manifests.

When using Workers Assets, Cloudflare will first attempt to serve any static assets which match the incoming request.

For example, if you have requests for `/logo.png` and `/blog/hello-world.html` in your assets directory, and make requests for `/logo.png` and `/blog/hello-world`, those files will be served respectively. The [`html_handling`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/#html_handling) option allows you to customize the serving of HTML files if you have specific needs around redirects and trailing slashes.

If a request does not match a static asset, Cloudflare will then invoke your Worker script module, if one is present. This can be configured with the [`main`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/#inheritable-keys) property in the `wrangler.toml / wrangler.json` file.

Finally, if a request does not match any static assets, and either a Worker script module is not present, or from within that Worker script module, the [asset binding](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/binding/)'s `fetch` method is called (e.g. `env.ASSETS.fetch(request)`), Cloudflare will fall back to evaluating the [`not_found_handling`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/routing/#not_found_handling) behavior. By default, it will serve a null-body 404-status response, but this can be configured to instead serve custom HTML 404 pages, or to serve a single-page application (SPA).

At present, there is no way to customize this routing behavior beyond the `html_handling` and `not_found_handling` options. We plan to offer additional configuration controls, such as allowing you to always run the Worker script modules for certain paths, in the future.
